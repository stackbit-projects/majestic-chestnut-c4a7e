### The arguably greatest master of the art of kung fu had once said, “I’m not scared of the thousand moves that you have practised once, but the one move that you have practised a thousand times that makes my legs quiver.”

Quite interestingly, he **never** explained what one would do, if one fails her or himself flailing in despair at the one move that she or he thought that they *had mastered. *

What if the sun forgot how to burn brighter with each passing day? Or if the waves began to dwindle into oblivion as they neared the rocky shores; ones that they would have generously and mercilessly trampled, at the height of their intimidating aura.

What if the storm began to anxiously look over its shoulders every time it considered uprooting a few trees in its path, earlier an errand performed just for play’s sake,

##### now a herculean task to even contemplate about it.

You look in the mirror, as if to validate yourself. With every muscle that you flex, *you seem to become stranger than you had ever imagined yourself to be*. 

The scariest part? It's **you** who gets spooked by this the most, not your close ones, not your allies, nor your demons, but the one you had trusted the most, all this time. 

> And then you ask, why fight? 
> Suddenly it's not your battle anymore. Anything that happens around you, seems to be eliminated by the tunnel vision that you have all of a sudden seemed to adopt.

**Redundancy**, a trait that you had hated the most, it made you predictable, you used to say, suddenly seems to provide you with a comfortable shelter, to rest your head amidst a dark storm. All seems good again, the pain is bearable, the burden doesn’t kill you, only pushes you against the floor: low enough to graze your nose against the gravel in the most gentle and inevitably humiliating manner. 

All that’s left, is for you to kiss; your fate, your diminished stature, essentially a mediocrity that you now consider to be a soothing normal.

And maybe, just a tiny question: **Why fight?**

###### Another popular quote goes as, “If you want to become something that you have never been before, you need to do something that you’ve never done before.”

If I were to present a slightly altered version, I’d say, you need to be pushed against a wall that you’ve never surmounted before. A hurdle that is impossible to cross, until of course, you do it.

##### You reason, is this really me? Since when did I start making decisions in such cold blood, a passionless fervour and even lower myself further by celebrating the leftovers of happiness that I force myself to enjoy, a facade taken up to be a part of a company, one that I fear to lose with the prospect of losing my newfound identity.

Yup, to change is human, but not at the stake of **giving up your identity**. 
A metal is moulded, beaten into new shape,* but never discarded and replaced with a substitute or tagged as unaltered.  *

You were destined to change the way the stars moved across the galaxy, not to find your fate in a void of perplexing randomness. 

You fight, because you are not done. Not now, not tomorrow. And most importantly, never with yourself.

> You don’t have a reputation to maintain, you’ve got dogmas to destroy.

You’ve got every right to criticise yourself, to **rip yourself apart** to absolute nakedness. 
No one can judge you more than you yourself; if you leave no stone unturned to do that, you’ll grow numb to every pebble sent as carefully parcelled presents, from the onlookers. 

#### You can’t please everyone, but you do have an obligation to not let yourself down, in your eyes. 

No matter how hard you fall, if you know how to lift yourself up, more importantly, if you know when to stifle your cries and scald those burns yourself; and at the same time, if you know when to treat yourself with patience and respect all those tears that well up but never flow,
*you do not grow stronger, you become invincible.*

And that’s why you fight, because you have an obligation. You had made a tryst with yourself, to not look towards the Dying Light, the Gentle Night, every time you had survived something that you had thought you could not. 

> So break through every chain that holds you back, let go of the fears that have become your closest friends.
> Be alone for a while. 

Rome wasn’t built in a day, and believe it or not, no matter how bad you’ve lost, it couldn’t have been built **without you losing** in that precise manner.

With heads held higher than our past forms, walk with pride. There’s an addiction to struggle, which can’t be possessed without *You, Your mind*, and *Your Body* working in unison.

## You were meant to lose, to cry, to be scarred, to be maligned, cause greatness isn’t peaceful, and cannot be remotely felt as long you’re satisfied with yourself, unless of course ...

You’re already where you wanted to be, i.e. your memories in the hearts of your admirers and your smiling face, lying in the shade of a coffer.
